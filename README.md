# assotextmining - Text mining project using the Facebook Graph API, Python and R


School text mining project for a Linguistics course using the Facebook Graph API, Python language and R.

## Context

Aim was to study some linguistics on the posts from a student facebook group counting about 7000 members over a time period of 1 semester. To achieve that, we used python scripts to query the FB Graph API and get a great dataset of about 5000 posts (stored in json). Then we've cleaned the dataset thanks to other python scripts and proceed to analytics thanks to R scripts.

## Realisation

Implemented :
* FB Graph API requesting scripts in python
* JSON dataset cleaning scripts in python
* Data analytics scripts in R
